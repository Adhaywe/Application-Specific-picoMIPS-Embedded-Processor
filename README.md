# Application Specific picoMIPS Embedded Processor
The objective of this project is to develop an 8-bit application-specific picoMIPS processor which implements the affine transformation
with the least possible hardware resources.

## Test
The design is successfully simulated in ModelSim and a demonstration in the FPGA device has shown that it carried out the assigned 
task correctly over a wide range of input numbers.
